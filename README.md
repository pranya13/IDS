# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

A Python-based IDS that monitors ARP traffic to detect spoofing attacks in a LAN. Suspicious activity is flagged instantly and logged into a CSV file for future analysis.

## üöÄ Features
- Monitors ARP packets using Scapy  
- Detects IP-MAC mismatches (ARP spoofing)  
- Console alerts for real-time warnings  
- Unique Feature: Logs alerts into `alerts.csv` with timestamp for forensic analysis  

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- Input: Live ARP traffic from the network  
- Process: Sniffs ARP packets ‚Üí Validates IP-MAC mapping ‚Üí Detects spoof ‚Üí Logs  
- Output:  
  - Console alert: `[ALERT] ARP Spoofing Detected! IP 192.168.1.1 is being spoofed by xx:xx:xx:xx`  
  - CSV log entry: `2025-08-25 19:30, ARP Spoofing Detected! IP 192.168.1.1 ...`  

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Instructions
```bash
pip install scapy
